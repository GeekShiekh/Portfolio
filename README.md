My name is Yousif Mohamad. I have worked as a Build Engineer, Junior Software Developer and Producer for the last two years (2021-present).

You will find some of the scripts that I have developed and can share in this repository. 
- Commit-CE-dir-to-P4.py - Committing asset(s) to Perforce using the p4python module. Other functions include versioning, reverting a submission if no changes have been detected, and copying one directory and overwriting to a destination directory.
- shuffle-steam-builds-down.py - Manipulate builds in steam depots using the [steamctl CLI utlity](https://github.com/ValvePython/steamctl). 
- upload-to-steam.py - Steam uploader that duplicates the app_build.vdf file, replaces the contents of the duplicate with new values, and performs an upload using [steamcmd.exe](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD).
- versioning.py - General-purpose 'replace-string-in-text-file' .py script, engineered for versioning purposes using the 'Major-minor-build-revision' format.

Other scripts that I have developed (such as pipeline Groovy and C# scripts) are not my property and cannot be shared under the Creative Commons licence. However, I can disclose that these scripts have been developed on **Windows** and **OSX** platforms, built using **Unreal Engine 5** and **Unity** on the command line and executed on the **Jenkins** continuous-integration automation service.
